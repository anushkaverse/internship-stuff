# 🛠 Internship Project Tools – Trinity Infonet Solutions

This repository contains three key automation tools developed during my internship at **Trinity Infonet Solutions**, built using **Python** for internal IT process optimization. These tools were created to simplify and streamline operations related to **engineer deployment**, **IT asset tracking**, and **AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) management**.

## 📦 Contents

### 🔧 Engineer Allocation Tool  
Assign engineers to clients based on skill level, location, and availability.

- `engineer_allocation_tool.py`  
- `engineers.csv`  
- Generates `allocation_log.csv` after assignments

**Features:**  
- View all engineers  
- Filter by skill, location, or specialization  
- Allocate engineer and update availability
