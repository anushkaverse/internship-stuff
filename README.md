# 🛠 Internship Project Tools – Trinity Infonet Solutions

This repository contains three key automation tools developed during my internship at **Trinity Infonet Solutions**, built using **Python** for internal IT process optimization. These tools were created to simplify and streamline operations related to **engineer deployment**, **IT asset tracking**, and **AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) management**.

## 📦 Tools Included

### 1. 🚀 Engineer Allocation Tool
A Python-based script to automatically allocate available engineers to new client tickets based on workload, availability, and expertise. The tool reads engineer logs, assigns tasks intelligently, and maintains an up-to-date assignment sheet.

**Features:**
- Reads real-time ticket data from `.csv`/`.xls`
- Dynamic allocation logic based on availability
- Auto-updates master sheet with assigned engineers

---

### 2. 💻 IT Asset Tracker
A file-handling-based system that parses, cleans, and updates asset inventories using structured data files. It helps maintain a clear record of assets across departments, flagging duplicates and missing entries.

**Features:**
- Reads and processes `.csv` inventory files
- Detects duplicate/missing asset entries
- Categorizes assets by department/type

---

### 3. 🔔 Automatic AMC Reminder Tool
A Python script that scans asset purchase and AMC renewal dates to send timely alerts when contracts are about to expire.

**Features:**
- Scans for assets nearing AMC expiration
- Sends email alerts (or logs them for manual action)
- Helps IT teams stay compliant and avoid downtime

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas
- Openpyxl
- Datetime module
- OS / Sys modules
- Email (smtplib) – optional setup

---

## ✅ Outcomes

- Reduced manual workload for the IT and support teams
- Improved accuracy of asset records and AMC scheduling
- Delivered practical, modular tools adopted by internal teams

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Real-world use of Python for business automation
- Working with structured data formats like CSV/XLS
- Process logic design, file I/O, and scheduling
- Writing maintainable code for non-technical users
